                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>Even if it feels like our lives are governed at every scale by the ubiquity of digital media &mdash; tweets, emails, facebook posts, and snapchats &mdash; at the end of the day, our lived experiences are all about space. The spaces of
                    a city, a park, a bathroom, a train station, a public square, a national border, an airport, a farm, a factory, a school, a warehouse, a church, a club: this is where life takes place, where inequalities occur, where politics begins,
                    and where change can happen. </p>
                <p>The Spatial Activism Workshop is a discussion series and workshop/hackathon weekend at the intersection of urbanism, activism, and technology. What political and social change can start at this intersection? What technologies can be active
                    (or activist!) in helping address issues of spatial inequality, displacement, and access?</p>
                <p>We are bringing together engaged, smart, and thoughtful people and organizations from many disciplines &mdash; architects, urbanists, technologists, lawyers, activists, non-profits, and historians. We start with a symposium on <strong>April 16</strong>,
                    with presentations from brilliant folks working in the areas of design, urbanism, activism, and technology, and follow up the next weekend of <strong>April 22-23</strong> with a series of workshops and a hackathon to see what we can
                    build together.
                </p>
                <p>Our goals are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build awareness of the issues and get people excited</li>
                    <li>Make action-oriented projects that address specific issues of space, social justice, and urbanism through technology</li>
                    <li>Connect networks together to foster collaboration / support</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We're convinced that there's lots of potential at the intersection between urbanism, activism, and technology. We know that amazing things happen when we bring together the right ingredients, and we're excited to see what those things
                    are. We're looking forward for you to join us!</p>

                <p>Here are some ideas that illustrate what kind of intersections between urbanism, activism, and technology we're talking about.
